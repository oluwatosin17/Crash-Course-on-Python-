- Here's a quick refresher on syntax and semantics. In a human language, **syntax** is the rules for how a sentence is constructed while
**semantics** refers to the actual meaning of the statements. 
- In a programming language like Python, the syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written and the semantics is the effects the
instructions have. 
- So what's the difference between a **script** and a **program?** The line between the two can be a bit blurry. In this course, we'll use
the terms interchangeably. In general, you can think of **scripts** as programs with a short development cycle that can be created and deployed rapidly. In other words, a **script** is a program that is short, simple, and can be written very quickly.
