-  In a human language, **syntax** is the rules for how a sentence is constructed while
**semantics** refers to the actual meaning of the statements. 
- In a programming language like Python, the syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written and the semantics is the effects the
instructions have. 
- So what's the difference between a **script** and a **program?** The line between the two can be a bit blurry. In general, you can think of **scripts** as programs with a short development cycle that can be created and deployed rapidly. In other words, a **script** is a program that is short, simple, and can be written very quickly.. 

- *Automation* is the process of replacing
a manual step with one that happens automatically. 
- Some benefit of automation is consistency. 
- Automation isn't a solution for every situation, some tasks just
aren't suited for automation. For example, they may require a degree of
creativity or flexibility that automatic systems can't provide or for more
complicated or less frequently executed tasks creating the automation may actually
be more effort or cost than it's worth. 

- Automation is a powerful tool when used
in the right place at the right moment. It can save time, reduce errors,
increase consistency, and provide a way to centralized solutions and
mistakes making them easier to fix. 

-Python interpreter. In programming, an interpreter is the program that reads
and executes code.
